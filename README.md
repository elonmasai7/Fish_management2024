Users will be able to log in, and depending on what type of user they are, perform various actions. Database administrator users will be able to view the full database and edit it as necessary. Customers will be able to make an account, and then view a list of the fish in stock, and then place orders. They will be able to view any orders they have placed as well as leave reviews and comments.
